CS-354 Machine Organization and Programming

These are two of my favorite projects from CS-354 taught by professor Skrentny

mem.c: this program is a memory allocator in c. It initializes a memory space and from there can allocate and free memory blocks.
The blocks come with block headers and adjacent free blocks are automatically coalescd.

csim.c: A cache simulator that can replay traces from Valgrind and output statistics such as number of hits, 
misses, and evictions.  The replacement policy is LRU.
  Implementation and assumptions:
   1. Each load/store can cause at most one cache miss plus a possible eviction.
  2. Instruction loads (I) are ignored.
  3. Data modify (M) is treated as a load followed by a store to the same
  address. Hence, an M operation can result in two cache hits, or a miss and a
   hit plus a possible eviction.
 The function printSummary() is given to print output.
